<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<p>I've worked for companies large and small; from Cisco, EA, IBM and Citrix, to non-profit organizations, and many in between. I love learning new things and have loved coding for a long time but I used to really, really not like JavaScript and even went to design school to avoid it. These days, the worm has turned and I love JavaScript! I primarily write web applications in JavaScript (Angular, Node.js, Meteor) or Ruby on Rails. I have a couple of years of experience in Python and JavaScript, and have dabbled with Ruby. I worked in the PHP / WordPress world for a while <i>(please don't hate me)</i>. I learned to code in BASIC, albeit an extremely long time ago (GOTO 1995), and Pascal after that.</p>

<p>Before working in web development, I worked as a (linux and Windows) sysadmin, and technical support before that. I got a bit bored of doing IT. I went to design school for some reason (Emily Carr Institute and BCIT), to learn the principles behind good design, to inform my work making websites (note: this is not the right approach, but it involved very little of the dreaded calculus, which I'm now cool with). I have been making websites for longer than I'd care to admit (my first site was on GeoCities in 1997). I was freelancing, doing web design and PHP / WordPress / Drupal etc development, and then got pregnant. I took some time off, and I decided to switch stacks. I'm currently working part-time on my Bachelor of Computer Science (majoring in Software Development) at UNE, and have done a ton of MOOCs.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>In my spare time, I bake, I knit and I drink a lot of coffee. I read a lot, mostly non-fiction but also sci-fi/fantasy. I enjoy learning new languages, both computer and human (Spanish, French, Swedish so far and working on German and Italian). I primarily use linux (Ubuntu currently) but I also have lots of computers, a Mac and a gaming PC. I live in the middle of nowhere <i>(although saying that makes it sound slightly more cosmopolitan than it actually is)</i>, it's literally in the middle of the woods, but I do have internet so it's not all bad. I live in Canada but I don't ski or eat bacon (but please don't tell them that). I like Star Trek, Star Wars, Game of Thrones (asoiaf books especially), and I <i>try</i> not to be a nerd about it. I'm kind of an indoor enthusiast (as Jeff Atwood says). I run because there is a lot of wildlife around here who might want to eat me and I want to be prepared.</p>
