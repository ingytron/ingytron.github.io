<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<p>I've worked for companies large and small; from Cisco, IBM and Citrix, to fledgeling freelancers and non-profit organizations, and many in between. I love learning new things and have loved coding for a long time but I used to really, really not like JavaScript and even went to design school to avoid it. These days, the worm has turned and I love JavaScript! I primarily write web applications in JavaScript (Angular, Node.js) or Ruby on Rails. I have a couple of years of experience in Ruby, Python, JavaScript and other web technologies.</p>

<p>Before diving into web development, I worked as a sysadmin and technical support, but I got a bit bored of doing IT. I went to design school (Emily Carr Institute and BCIT) to learn the principles behind good design, in order to make better looking websites. I have been making websites for longer than I'd care to admit (my first site was on GeoCities in 1997). </p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>In my spare time, I bake, I knit and I'm a wine lover. I read a lot, mostly non-fiction. I enjoy learning new languages, both computer and human (Spanish, French, Swedish so far and working on German and Italian). I run linux but I also have a Mac and a PC for gaming. I live in the middle of nowhere, although saying that makes it sound slightly more cosmopolitan than it actually is. I live in Canada and I don't ski or eat bacon so I'll probably be thrown out soon. I like Star Trek, Star Wars, Game of Thrones (asoiaf books especially), but I try not to be a nerd about it. I like to go outdoors occasionally and go hiking and swimming. I also run because there is a lot of wildlife around here who might want to eat me and I want to be prepared.</p>
