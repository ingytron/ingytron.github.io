<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<p>I've worked for companies large and small; from Cisco, EA, IBM and Citrix, to fledgling freelancers and non-profit organizations, and many in between. I love learning new things and have loved coding for a long time but I used to really, really not like JavaScript and even went to design school to avoid it. These days, the worm has turned and I love JavaScript! I primarily write web applications in JavaScript (Angular, Node.js) or Ruby on Rails. I have a couple of years of experience in Ruby, Python, JavaScript and other web technologies.</p>

<p>Before diving into web development, I worked as a sysadmin and technical support, but I got a bit bored of doing IT. I went to design school (Emily Carr Institute and BCIT) to learn the principles behind good design, in order to make better looking websites. I have been making websites for longer than I'd care to admit (my first site was on GeoCities in 1997). [read the long version] </p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>In my spare time, I bake, I knit and I'm a wine lover. I read a lot, mostly non-fiction. I enjoy learning new languages, both computer and human (Spanish, French, Swedish so far and working on German and Italian). I run linux but I also have a Mac and a PC for gaming. I live in the middle of nowhere, although saying that makes it sound slightly more cosmopolitan than it actually is. I live in Canada and I don't ski or eat bacon so I'll probably be thrown out soon. I like Star Trek, Star Wars, Game of Thrones (asoiaf books especially), but I try not to be a nerd about it. I like to go outdoors occasionally and go hiking and swimming. I also run because there is a lot of wildlife around here who might want to eat me and I want to be prepared.</p>

 <h2>Background (the long version)</h2>

        <!--img src="/assets/snake.png"-->
        <p>I was a computer fix-it kid, I read computer manuals and tweaked DOS files to improve game performance. I helped my Dad recover his work computer after my sister accidentally ran a deletion macro (it was a single keystroke!) and after that I found myself with a bit of a job helping fix computer problems at my Dad's office and for others. At school, my computer teacher ran out of things for me to do and handed me a BASIC manual and that's what got me started me writing code, later I learned Pascal (but I don't remember much now) and HyperCard. I did a tertiary course in computing during my high school years, and another at night school but it was rather boring and basic, and I even ended up teaching the class at one point (I was 17 at the time, but the instructor needed some help with using Excel).</p>

        <p>I got a job at Compaq right from school and worked my way up through tech support. I later worked as a systems administrator and datacentre engineer, working on mission-critical systems, mostly linux and Windows servers. I moved to Canada to work briefly for Fortinet, doing technical support for their firewall products (configuration, VPN connectivity, e-mail scanning) and was then headhunted by IBM. Unfortunately, I found the corporate phone-support environment stifling and the thrill of fixing issues was absent, and my heart just wasn't in it anymore. I needed a change and decided to pursue my interest in web development instead.</p>

        <h4>Get(ting) with the programming</h4>

        <p>I started out with HTML4 and CSS, but I wasn't really good at programming because I think I was trying to learn JavaScript and it just really never came together for me, and PHP is an absolutely horrible first language, both are hard to read and the syntax drove me crazy. Undeterred, I built myself an online store, which I built with osCommerce. I figured out how to get it to work and hacked it together with some really ugly PHP, and my friend who is a graphic designer did a logo for me. It was marginally profitable but I decided it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. This was really my first brush with a content management system, and they sure did make life easier. I found WordPress started to build sites using it, theming, more theming. I tried working with WooThemes but I just wanted more flexibility. I worked with Drupal for a while too, but it wasn't as slick as WordPress, and overkill for most sites anybody ever asked me to build (which invariably consisted of a home page, an about page, a contact page and make sure the address is on there somewhere too). I worked more with WordPress and the Genesis Theme Framework. I was hacking away at PHP to do things and the syntax was still awful, but it worked. </p>

        <p>I built quite a lot of websites for friends with just HTML and CSS, but I wanted to know how to build sites which looked a little better, I googled extensively and found that most of the sites that I liked were designed by graphic designers. Armed with that knowledge, I went to graphic design school. I learned the fundamentals of design (which is something I wanted to learn). I did PHP training, I knew SQL quite well from my work doing system administration, but then I discovered Ruby on Rails and it really let me build something to my own specification, without worrying about having to use 87 plugins and many of the issues that you get with using WordPress.</p>

        <p>Suddenly I realised that not only was I unable to withstand bad design, but after design school, I also found myself in the unusual position of being a designer who preferred to code things myself rather than hand over everything to a developer. I enjoyed the process of making things and so I delved further into the coding side of things, and just when I made the decision to forge my own path as a freelancer, I found out that I was pregnant. I took a break from working because babies and deadlines are not a good combination,so for the past 4 years I have mostly just been doing a lot of coding exercises and working through tutorials on current web technologies. I've been working towards addressing skill gaps in Computer Science, so I've been taking a lot of self-directed learning over the past few years, through MOOCs and online training providers. I live way out in the country, on an island, so three cheers for online learning!</p>

        <p>An aside: You might be wondering why I'm learning Python (MIT) as well as C (Harvard), and also JavaScript (FreeCodeCamp), and the simple reason is that learning Python is a segue to learning more advanced Computer Science topics, which in general, either require knowledge of Python or Java.</p>

        <p>Skills go somewhere, include SQL</p>
        <p>HTTP, TCP/IP</p>
