<h1>How to free up room on /boot</h1>

<p>If you've been running Ubuntu for a while and have a smallish /boot drive, then chances are you might run out of space on it. This happens to me at least every few months and this is what I do:</p>

<h4>Step 1.</h4>
<p>Check which kernel version you're currently running. You definitely don't want to delete the one you're using.</p>

<code>
uname -r 
</code>

<h4>Step 2.</h4>
<p>Find out which kernels you have installed and don't need:</p>

<code>
sudo dpkg --list 'linux-image-*'
</code>

<h4>Step 3.</h4>
<p>Removed unwanted / unneeded kernels.</p>
<code>
sudo apt-get remove linux-image-<em>[version]</em>
</code>

<p>For example:</p> 
<code>sudo apt-get remove linux-image 3.16.0-50-generic</code>

<p>Make sure to leave at least a few previous images in case you need to roll back to an older image.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Check how much room you've freed.</p>
<code>df /boot</code>
<p>If you are happy with the amount of available space, then continue. If not, go back and remove some more images.</p>


<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Use autoremove to clean out the packages you no longer need.</p>
<code>
	sudo apt-get autoremove
</code>

<h4>Step 6 (optional)</h4>
<p>If you are using Grub and want to clear out old packages from your boot menu, use the following command:</p>

<code>sudo update-grub</code>

<p>All done! </p>
