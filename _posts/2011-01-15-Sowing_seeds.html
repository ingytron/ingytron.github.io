<p><strong>Description</strong>This website project was created for a bookkeeper client starting a new business. The design was in keeping with the client's tagline "practical accounting for your business growth". I designed the logo and brand identity, created the illustrations and built out the site using WordPress and a custom theme I created.</p>

<p><strong>Project type:</strong> Website, Print</p>

<p><strong>Built using:</strong> WordPress, PHP, JavaScript</p>
