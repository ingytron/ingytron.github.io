<p>I was just trying to figure out how to check the version of SpamAssassin from the command line and this line of perl does the trick, in case you need it (remove the square brackets, of course):</p><!--more-->

<code># perl -MMail::SpamAssassin -e ''print $Mail::SpamAssassin::VERSION;''</code>

<p>Hope that helps someone out, and <a href="http://blog.eulinux.org/2009/01/how-to-check-spamassassin-version.html">thanks to Floyd for the tip</a>.</p>
