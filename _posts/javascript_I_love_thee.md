        <p>The other thing is that <strong>I've learned to stop worrying and love the JavaScript.</strong> It's about a zillion times better these days because online training is fantastic and instant feedback is far better than having to copy code out of a manual and then later read it was a printing error (so frustrating!). Anyhow, that kind of snowballed and I've been taking courses on Python development, algorithms, and mostly I've just been trying to do a bunch of practice and writing a lot of code for various projects that I've been working on whilst I took a break for mat leave. My plan was to take some time off and build out some projects in WordPress but finding how to build the right solution using WordPress turned into WordPress isn't the be-all and end-all of doing things and the projects that I was trying to build were a better fit for being built in RoR, so that's what I set out to do instead.</p>
