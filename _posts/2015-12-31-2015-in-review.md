**2015**

Well it was a good year, but now it's over. I did a lot of study, worked on my projects a bit, but not as much as just writing a bit of code for fun and course work. It was a bit of a strange year, for example I did a marketing campaign for a client and I'm still not really sure why. <!--more-->

I did some IT consulting, some design and a ton of self-directed study.
