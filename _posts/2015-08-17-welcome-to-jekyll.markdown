This is my first post on my new blog. I'm not sure if I'll import my old blog, seeing as most of it was drivel anyhow, or outdated tech how-tos that nobody read. 

I'm keeping this here for reference...

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
