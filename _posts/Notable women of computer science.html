Margaret Hamilton

Main claim to fame: The brains behind Apollo’s flight control software

Credentials: As the Director of the Software Engineering Division at Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, she headed up the team which designed and built the on-board flight control software for NASA’s Apollo and Skylab missions. Based on her Apollo work, she later developed the Universal Systems Language and Development Before the Fact paradigm. Pioneered the concepts of asynchronous software, priority scheduling, and ultra-reliable software design. Coined the term “software engineering.” Winner of the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award in 1986 and NASA’s Exceptional Space Act Award in 2003.

Quotes: “Hamilton invented testing , she pretty much formalised Computer Engineering in the US.” ford_beeblebrox

“I think before her (and without disrespect including Knuth) computer programming was (and to an extent remains) a branch of mathematics. However a flight control system for a spacecraft clearly moves programming into a different paradigm.” Dan Allen

“... she originated the term ‘software engineering’ — and offered a great example of how to do it.” David Hamilton
