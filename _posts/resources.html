<h1>Resources for learning to code</h1>


<p>There's an abundance of great learning to code resources available for people who want to learn. I've been coding for half my life but recently I moved from doing PHP / WordPress (with a bit of light javascript) development to full stack javascript (while on maternity leave, because it's fun). Here are the resources that I have found to be the most helpful while retraining as a full-stack javascript developer. </p>


<h2>Learn to Code Resources:</h2>

<h3>Free:</h3>

<strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> - At top of the list for a reason, learn full stack javascript web development from scratch, for free (as in freedom). By far the best of the lot.
<strong>Codecademy</strong> - A range of well-designed and supported interactive tutorials to start you off.
<strong>Khan Academy</strong> - Provides free educational resources for learning computer science, such as algorithms and data structures.
<strong>Udacity</strong> - Primarily for learning Python, but also offers a range of JavaScript courses. You can take their courses for free, or enrol in one of their NanoDegree programs (for $200/month) if you'd like a credential.
