        <h3>Professional Experience:</h3> 
        <p><lead>Widely applicable knowledge of computer hardware, software troubleshooting, databases, network management and system administration with a focus on web server technologies. I enjoy building projects with JavaScript (and jQuery) / Angular. I also like Ruby on Rails and Python but I'm still learning those, I've focused on building up my JavaScript knowledge before I dabble too much, but I have build projects in Ruby and Python.</lead></p>

        <h4>Recent Courses</h4>
        <p>I have been doing a lot of self-directed learning over the past few years, through MOOCs and online training providers. I live way out in the country, on an island, so three cheers for online learning!</p>

        <p>No. I don't have an official degree. I'm have been working through some official Computer Science curriculum and one day I would like to have a degree but it's a lot of financial commitment. I went to design school but did a condensed 2 year program, which ran for one calendar year. Years ago, I was going to technical school to get a certificate in "I can fix computers" but I already could fix computers and decided that I would just work instead. I was a Microsoft MCSE at one point, self-taught. I also did a bunch of Unix training on the job from the old Digital VAX guys when I was in server support. I've been building and designing websites since about 1999 (#geocities, #represent) and have built a plethora of hand-coded HTML sites which are unfit for human viewing in this day and age. I went to design school to find out how to make websites more attractive, after dabbling in CMS systems for years (and running an online store). The thing is, anytime you do web design, you have to write code anyway, and I like coding so I just thought I'd dive in, I stopped worrying and learned to love the javascript. </p>

        <p>I went to a talk by Stefan Sagmeister in 2008 and he is amazing. I absolutely love his work. </p>

        <h2>The long version</h2>
        <h3>A selection of mini-essays about myself</h3>

        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I was a computer fix-it kid, I read computer manuals and tweaked <code>DOS</code> to improve game performance (img: I got that snake to go so fast that we couldn't play it. I helped my Dad recover his work computer after my sister accidentally ran a deletion macro (it was a single keystroke!). My computers teacher ran out of things to do and so started me writing code in BASIC, later Pascal. I did a tertiary course in computing during my high school years, and another at night school but it was rather boring and basic, and I even ended up teaching the class at one point (I was 17 at the time, but the instructor needed some help with using Excel) I got a job at Compaq right from school and worked my way up through tech support. I later worked as a systems administrator and datacentre engineer, working on mission-critical systems, mostly linux and Windows servers. I moved to Canada to work briefly for Fortinet, doing technical support for their firewall products (configuration, VPN connectivity, e-mail scanning) and was then headhunted by IBM. Unfortunately, the thrill was gone and I found that my heart just wasn't in it anymore. I needed a change and decided to pursue my interest in web design instead.</p>

        <blockquote>I can servers and design networks. I'm very technically curious and always know how things work and how we can better solve problems. </blockquote>


        <p>I wanted design to be enough, but it turns out that I'm highly picky about how code should be written, and I just preferred to do it myself rather than hand over everything to a developer, plus I have been freelancing since before my first child was born. I found that doing everything myself and also trying to attract clients, who had deadlines, was too much to ask of myself while I had small kids, so I took a break from working for clients and have just been doing a lot of coding and tutorials.  </p>

        <h4>Get with the programming</h4>

        <p>I started out with HTML4 and CSS, but I wasn't really good at programming because I think I was trying to learn JavaScript and it just really never came together for me. It was hard to read and the syntax drove me crazy because I was always getting the parentheses and semi-colons wrong. I built myself an online store, which I built with osCommerce. I figured out how to style it, fairly crudely, and my friend who is a graphic designer and artist did a logo for me. It was marginally profitable but I decided it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. This was really my first brush with a content management system, and they sure did make life easier. I found WordPress started to build sites using it, theming, more theming. I tried working with WooThemes but I just wanted more flexibility. I worked with Drupal for a while too, but it wasn't as slick as WordPress, and overkill for most sites anybody ever asked me to build (which invariably consisted of a home page, an about page, a contact page and make sure the address is on there somewhere too). I worked more with WordPress and the Genesis Theme Framework. I tried (and was not impressed by) Joomla, and also Magento. I was hacking away at PHP to do things and the syntax was still awful, but it worked. </p>

        <blockquote>Building sites for people and getting them to pay you adequately for it is a lot more challenging than I thought it would be. I desire stability and work/life balance.  </blockquote>

        <p>I built quite a lot of websites for friends with just HTML and CSS, but I wanted to know how to build sites which looked a little better, I googled extensively and found that most of the sites that I liked were designed by graphic designers. Armed with that knowledge, I went to graphic design school. I learned the fundamentals of design (which is something I wanted to learn). I did PHP training, I knew SQL quite well from my work doing system administration, but then I discovered Ruby on Rails and it really let me build something to my own specification, without worrying about having to use 15 plugins and security scanning issues that you get with WordPress, its ubiquity is also its own curse. </p>

        <em>If you have read this far, I owe you a cookie.</em><br>

<!--Fork this into a blog entry -->
        <p>The other thing is that <strong>I've learned to stop worrying and love the JavaScript.</strong> It's about a zillion times better these days because online training is fantastic and instant feedback is far better than having to copy code out of a manual and then later read it was a printing error (so frustrating!). Anyhow, that kind of snowballed and I've been taking courses on Python development, algorithms, and mostly I've just been trying to do a bunch of practice and writing a lot of code for various projects that I've been working on whilst I took a break for mat leave. My plan was to take some time off and build out some projects in WordPress but finding how to build the right solution using WordPress turned into WordPress isn't the be-all and end-all of doing things and the projects that I was trying to build were a better fit for being built in RoR, so that's what I set out to do instead.</p> 


        <p>Writing code is perfect for spelling and punctuation enthusiasts, such as myself. Although code may be poetry, not all code is poetry &mdash; and as with prose &mdash; it's always a good idea to copyedit &amp; proofread it. I will use as many ampersands as humanly possible because it's my favourite punctuation mark. </p>

  Focus on your Website Design and Development experience

Now I had done, E-Marketing, Project Management, Web Designing and had run multiple startups as well. In all of my experiences I had touched the web. I updated my resume and focused my experience to highlight all the ways I had worked on Websites.

    Using a Content Management System, like Drupal, WordPress, Joomla, Adobe CQ etc.
    Designing Websites, in Photoshop, HTML and CSS
    Some JQuery copy pasting I did to make some Web features work
    Strategizing Website Design
    Managing Agencies in Web Development and Website Migration Projects.
    Managing Teams to build Web Applications and enhancing its features.
    Search Engine Optimization

Now the above is good, because, it highlights I am in the Web Business, but It doesn’t highlight my development skills.
