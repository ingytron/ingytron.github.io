    <h4>Ingrid is a second-generation computer nerd (her dad was a COBOL programmer / instructor) and has had a computer for as long as she can remember. She learned to code when she was 13 and used to make silly adventure games in BASIC on her IBM 486. She once chose the wrong monitor refresh rate during a linux install and literally smoked the monitor, and thought it was pretty rad. She created her first GeoCities site in '97, first client site in '02, and first e-commerce site in '03 (PHP/OSCommerce). She now works mostly in JavaScript and Python.</h4>

<div id="education" class="col-md-3">

        <p>Although I don't have a formal degree. I'm have been working through a lot of Computer Science curriculum and am working towards a degree but it's a lot of financial commitment. I went to design school but did a condensed 2 year program, which ran for one calendar year. After high school, I went going to technical school to get a certificate in "I can fix computers" but I already could fix computers and decided that I would just work instead. I was a Microsoft MCSE at one point, self-taught. I also did a bunch of Unix training on the job from the old Digital VAX guys while I was in server support. I've been building and designing websites since about 1999 (#geocities #represent) and have built a plethora of hand-coded HTML sites which are unfit for human viewing in this day and age. I went to design school to find out how to make websites more attractive, after dabbling in CMS systems for years (and running an online store). The thing is, anytime you do web design, you have to write code anyway, and I like coding so I just thought I'd dive in, <em>I stopped worrying and learned to love the javascript</em>. </p>

        <p>I went to a talk by Stefan Sagmeister in 2008 and he was a huge inspiration. I also love the work of Paula Scher. I love design and especially typography. I'm not willing to say that print is dead, because it will always have a place, but small businesses usually have budgets for click-and-done design rather than hiring a designer, and so I don't do much print work anymore.</p>
