I've been writing code since I was 14, when the computer class teacher ran out of things for me to do and introduced me to BASIC, I also dabbled in a bit of Pascal. I got turned onto Unix and Linux early on, and have I've been building websites since about 1997, the moment I discovered the "view source" command. My first major undertaking was building an e-commerce site for hundreds of products. For some reason I used OSCommerce (it was good at the time) and mySQL. I was hooked on coding, and have been delving more and more into "proper" programming ever since.

For the past 4 years, I have been taking computer programming training. I had been using WordPress (and other PHP-based CMS solutions) to create websites for people but I found it somewhat limiting and I felt that I needed to learn more about how to actually write programs. I've taken Harvard CS50x and also have been studying Python so that I can take on more advanced computer science classes. I have also done some training in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but for the most part I've been concentrating on JavaScript.

I went to design school to train as a graphic designer (bit of a non-sequitur, I know, but I always thought I sucked at programming). Professionally, I had worked in technical support (yes, I can build and fix computers) and network / systems administration (Windows and Linux environments, routers, switches etc).

I'm comfortable working on the command line, I use Git and I have a knack for fixing things and solving problems.

I love learning, in my spare time I try to learn new human languages, and in addition to English, I speak Spanish, Swedish, Italian, French and am learning German. I love documentaries, especially ones about science, foreign films and sci-fi. I read a lot and I knit.

         <p>I'm a web developer and designer, with 15+ years making websites. I have hundreds of hours experience coding in Javascript, and have taken the time to study and practice it to an advanced level. As well as pure JavaScript, I also work with frameworks (AngularJS, NodeJS, Meteor).</p>

    <p>I've been building websites since the late '90s, and was working with LAMP stack until I switched to MEAN stack a couple of years ago. I have been working my way through <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a>, a Full Stack specialization on Coursera, and a BS in Computer Science, majoring in Software Development, at <a href="http://une.edu.au">UNE</a>. </p>

      <p>I enjoy geeky stuff, elegant typefaces, drinking a lot of coffee and reading.</p>

        <h1>Web Development Experience</h1>
        <p>I've been building websites since ancient times (the 90's). I started by reading HTML code and figuring out how it worked, and over the years I have worked with many PHP-based CMS frameworks (such as WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Joomla) and created themes for clients' websites, often making child themes for existing frameworks (like Genesis). I can get things done in PHP and have written some basic WordPress plugins for client use. I have in-depth knowledge of linux, with over 15 years experience running various flavours, and have worked with MySQL    databases extensively.</p>

        <li>Fluency with MacOS and system troubleshooting</li>

        <li>Problem solving skills to provide solutions to resolve complex issues</li>
        <li>Good understanding of web services technologies, QA tools, Automation tools, Source control technologies, Environments management and data masking technologies</li>
        <li>Team player with experience leading teams in solving complex issues. Experienced team mentor and technical trainer, with interviewing and employee onboarding experience.</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>In-depth knowledge of DNS, e-mail / SMTP, linux server configuration. Firewalls, network configuration, packet inspection, </p>

        <p>I''ve been pulling apart computers and putting them back together since I was a kid. We've always had a computer in the house. I began creating websites in 1997, it was fun figuring out how websites worked and I went crazy creating websites for all manner of ridiculous things (including the Cramps and the Smurfs). As time progressed, my friends and family were asking me to make websites for them. My first professional site was my sister''s <a href="http://hemlocked.com">alternative clothing website</a> in 2000 (we re-acquired the domain recently). Since then I've been creating websites and intranets for a variety of companies, and maintaining the server systems that they run on. I recently went to Emily Carr and BCIT to learn to make my websites look professional and less "boxy" and more like a full-page magazine ad, if you get my drift. </p>
        <p>I previously worked in Linux / Windows systems administration and Cisco networking / firewalls / security.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>

        <p>I've worked for companies large and small; from Cisco, EA, IBM and Citrix, to non-profit organizations, and many in between. I love learning new things and have loved coding for a long time but I used to really, really not like JavaScript &mdash; I even went to design school to avoid it!</p>

        <p>I got over my fear of it and now I love JavaScript! I'm working on a number of projects in JavaScript (Angular, Node.js, Meteor). I have a couple of years of experience / confidence with JavaScript and Python, and have dabbled with Ruby on Rails (or alone / Sinatra) and Go. I worked in the PHP / WordPress world for a while, but PHP is unusual, as far as programming languages go, and I found using Python to be far more enjoyable. I learned to code in BASIC when I was about 13, and Pascal after that.</p>

        <p>Before working in web development, I worked as a (linux and Windows) sysadmin, and did a little bit of automation with Python, and made command-line tools (like a Twitter client). Before that I worked in technical support.</p> 

        <p>Admittedly, I got a bit burned out of doing IT. I went to design school (Emily Carr Institute and BCIT), to learn the principles behind good design, to inform my work making websites (note: this is not the right approach). </p>

        <p>I've been making websites for longer than I'd care to admit (my first site was on GeoCities in 1997). I was freelancing, doing web design and PHP / WordPress / Drupal / Magento development (I'd call it development lite); I worked a ton with servers and troubleshooting, I refactored other people's code mostly and fixed problems, added functionality and did a lot of code reading. I took some time off, had a baby and moved to the country. About 4 days after the baby was born, after a few days of being awake a lot at night and having a lot of time to think, I decided to get over my fear of JavaScript (I could do menus and JQuery things but that was about it) and face it head on. I used MOOCs on Coursera and EdX, and on Udacity and Udemy, Codecademy and Code School. Also, seeing as I kind of just put it off for too long, I'm working part-time on my Bachelor of Computer Science (majoring in Software Development) at UNE, I am doing a Java course this semester and just finished up a Python course, and I'm finding the maths classes to be strangely fun.</p>

<h2>Me</h2>

<p>In my spare time, I bake, I knit and I watch documentaries. I read a lot, mostly non-fiction but also sci-fi/fantasy. I enjoy learning new languages, both computer and human (Spanish, French, Swedish so far and working on German and Italian). I primarily use linux (Ubuntu currently) but I also have lots of computers, a Mac and a gaming PC. I live in the middle of nowhere <i>(although saying that makes it sound slightly more cosmopolitan than it actually is)</i>, it's literally in the middle of the woods, but I do have internet so it's not all bad. I live in Canada but I don't ski or eat bacon (please don't tell them). I like Star Trek, Star Wars, Game of Thrones (asoiaf books especially), and I <i>try</i> not to be a nerd about it. I'm kind of an indoor enthusiast (as Jeff Atwood says). I run because there is a lot of wildlife around here who might want to eat me and I want to be prepared.</p>
