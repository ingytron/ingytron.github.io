                <a href="#">My resume is available here</a-->

<br />
        <p>I've been writing code since age 13 and building websites since ancient times (the late 90's). I've been freelancing for the past 5 years and being a stay-at-home parent. During this time, I've moved away from PHP and WordPress, and worked on improving my JavaScript and Python skills. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/coding-journey">(For the long version of my story so far, see the blog post about my coding journey</a>.)</p>

        <h1>Web Development Experience</h1>

        <p>Over the years, I have worked with many PHP-based CMS frameworks (such as WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Joomla) and created themes for clients' websites, sometimes from scratch and sometimes by making child themes for existing theme frameworks (like Genesis). I can get things done in PHP and have written some basic WordPress plugins for client use. I have in-depth knowledge of linux, with over 15 years experience running various flavours. I have worked extensively with MySQL databases and have also worked with MongoDB.</p> 

         <p>I have a couple of years of experience / confidence with JavaScript and Python, and have dabbled with Ruby on Rails (or alone / Sinatra) and Go. I'm comfortable working on the command line, I use Git and I have a knack for fixing things and solving problems.</p>

        <p>I have been working through a number of JavaScript training courses, including <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a>, a Full Stack specialization on Coursera. I recently started working on my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, majoring in Software Development, at <a href="http://une.edu.au"><abbr title="University of New England">UNE</abbr></a>. As well as pure JavaScript, I also work with JavaScript frameworks (AngularJS, NodeJS, Meteor) and am familiar with Django. I have some limited experience with Java also.</p>       

        <p>I love learning, in my spare time I try to learn new human languages, and in addition to English, I speak Spanish. I can get along okay in French, Swedish, and Italian. I plan to learn German next. I love documentaries, especially ones about science, foreign films and sci-fi. I read a lot (mostly non-fiction or fantasy and sci-fi) and I knit.</p>
