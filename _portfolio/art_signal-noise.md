excerpt: "Websites for Signal + Noise Media Art Festival"

I built the sites for the Signal + Noise Media Art Festival for 2010 and 2011. They had a separate site in a different server directories for each year that the festival had run (ten years in 2010). I reorganized their old sites so that they were user accessible from the main site, and gave them a single point for administration of all the WordPress-based sites (the static sites were kept for historical reasons did not need changing) while maintaining the original URLs. They had a problem with an SQL injection that was inserting adult-oriented spam links into their site footers, which I also cleared up for them. The site was created using WordPress with some custom PHP.

          <blockquote>Showcasing a spectrum of audio &amp; video works, online games, live action performances and immersive installations, Signal &amp; Noise is Vancouverâ€™s premier alternative media event.</blockquote>
