This website was built for a startup bookkeeping business. Their tagline was "Practical accounting for your business growth". In keeping with this theme, I designed their brand identity, cards and website to reinforce this idea and used the large splash image of growing seeds on the front page of the site. It was built with WordPress, I built a quote rotator in Javascript to display their client testimonials on the front page.
