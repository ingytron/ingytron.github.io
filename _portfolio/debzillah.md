This website was built for the pole dancer and performer Deb Roach (Debzillah). Deb needed a place to showcase her performance work and her workshops. Originally, I built the site when she was working as a personal trainer in Australia so some of this work is from that period. I created the sites using WordPress and the Genesis theme framework.
