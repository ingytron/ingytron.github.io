<h1>Resources for learning to code</h1>


<p>There's an abundance of great learning to code resources available for people who want to learn. I've been coding for half my life but recently I moved from doing PHP / WordPress (with a bit of light javascript) development to full stack javascript (while on maternity leave, because it's fun). Here are the resources that I have found to be the most helpful while retraining as a full-stack javascript developer. </p>


<h2>Learn to Code Resources:</h2>

<h3>Free:</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>FreeCodeCamp</strong> - At top of the list for a reason, learn full stack javascript web development from scratch, for free (as in freedom). By far the best of the lot, so don't let the lack of price tag deter you.</li>
<li><strong>Codecademy</strong> - A range of well-designed and supported interactive tutorials to start you off.</li>
<li><strong>Khan Academy</strong> - Provides free educational resources for learning computer science, covering advanced topics such as algorithms and data structures. The mathematics content is also phenomenal, and helped me with my university homework on a number of occasions!</li>
<li><strong>Udacity</strong> - Primarily for learning Python, but also offers a range of JavaScript courses. You can take their courses for free, or enrol in one of their NanoDegree programs (for $200/month) if you'd like a credential.</li>


<h3>Paid</h3>
<strong>Code School</strong>
<strong>Pluralsight</strong>
<strong>Sitepoint Premium</strong>
<strong>FrontEnd Masters</strong>
